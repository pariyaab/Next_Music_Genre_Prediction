# Next_Music_Genre_Prediction
This project explored music preferences and mental health using a Twitter dataset. The goal was to predict the next music genre a user might be interested in, considering their mental health diagnosis (among four categories) and their music listening history shared on Twitter. The analysis employed sequential models like LSTMs and GRUs.
